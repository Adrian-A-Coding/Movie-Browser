# Movie Browser
This is a java project that I wanted to have for users to search for a movie title and find it along with additional details for the viewer. These include details such as the director(s) and actors present in a film or series as well as details on the series for season length and count. There is also movie length as well as the average episode length for a given series that is selected.

The CSVs used within this project can be found on Kaggle here:

### Usage
Below is an example of the application running and returning a movie with it's detail after the full title is entered.
